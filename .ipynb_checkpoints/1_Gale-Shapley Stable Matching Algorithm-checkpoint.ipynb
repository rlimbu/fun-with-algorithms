    "Stable matching problems arise when matching members of two sets of equal size where each member has an ordered preference for members of the other set. Consider sets M of men and W of women looking for romantic partners. Each m ∈ M has a preference list for members of W and so does each w ∈ W for members of M.\n",
    "\n",
    "A matching is said to be stable when no pairing (m, w) exists such that m and w both prefer each other to their current partners. In other words, the condition for m and w to abandon their current parnters in favor of each other does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given equal number of men and women, the algorithm also ensures that no one is single, and polygamy and/or polyandry does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brute-force algorithm to find a stable matching given two sets M and W with *n* members each has a worst case running time of O(n!). This running time grows extremely fast, and so brute-force approaches are practically useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1962, David Gale and Lloyd Shapely showed that, given an equal number of men and women, it is always possible to come up with a stable matching of men and women. They presented an algorithm with the worst-case running time of O(n^2). Their algorithm is as follows:"

In the above example, all the men get their most preferred partners whereas all the women get only their second choices. Hence, this algorithm also demonstrates the inherently unfair nature of certain human transactions."
